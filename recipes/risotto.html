        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This classic mushroom risotto is cooked the slow and painful way, but-oh so worth it! Perfect as an Italian main dish or side dish that complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).</p>
